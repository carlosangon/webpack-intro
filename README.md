# Intro to Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - [Documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/)

We'll be focusing on using webpack to help organize the build process for a complex frontend project. webpack is a nodeJS based tool that works with both commonJS and requireJS module format systems.

### Topics we'll be covering:

* How webpack works
* Understanding loaders
* Adding a javascript loader ( pretty much the reason we're here right? )
* Adding a loader for CSS pre-processors ( more than two pre-processors at the same time? insanity! )
* Adding the babelJS loader for ES6-7 syntax pre-processing!
* Understanding the power of plugins
* Using the Dedupe and UglifyJs Plugins to pack up our frontend code
* Adding hot reloading to a project ( believe me you'll want to see this )
